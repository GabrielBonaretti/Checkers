# Checkers

This small project is a checkers game made in Java, to train my knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP) and the native Java graphical tool (Java Swing). The game is intended to be the same as the physical game, with all its features. But, we currently have the following features:

## Actualy features:
  - The game only has pawns, so the logic of promoting to queen was not done, because of this it is possible for pawns to move backwards so the game does not crash;
  - Turn logic of all pieces;
  - All the logic of eating the other pieces;
  - Checking possible moves;
  - Pawns are represented graphically by images;
  - Status bar, where it shows who the current round is and how many pieces are left for each player;
  - A reset button to reset the game whenever you want.

## Technologies used:
  - Java;
  - Java Swing.

## Improvement points:
  - Implement some logic with ennums;
  - Add pawn promotion logic for queens;
  - Create an .exe file for this game.

To play you need to download the repository or git clone, go to the path file:
  - .\src\Aplication\main.java
And run the code.
